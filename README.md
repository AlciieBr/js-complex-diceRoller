# js-complex-diceRoller
This is a series of functions to roll dices with complex arguments like explode, keep higher...


Nowadays these commands can do the roll, but it's my second project in JS and the code isn't perfect
My next steps here are:

-> Improve the code/regex to not be "order sensitive" and understand "5d6!kh3" and "5d6kh3!" as the same thing

-> Clean and improve the code to be smaller and not harm the eyes
